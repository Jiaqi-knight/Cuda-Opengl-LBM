# Cuda-Opengl-LBM
Lattice-Botlzmann fluid simulator using CUDA and OpenGL

CUDA and OpenGL packages were used to graphically accelerate the Lattice-Boltzmann Method
(LBM) Algorithms. Through the use of parallelization and efficient memory usage, considerable
optimization and efficiency is possible with LBM simulation. In this simulation, we model constant
2 dimensional fluid flow through a medium, and at every lattice node the fluidâ€™s curl, probabilistic
velocity vectors, and pressure are calculated and available to be plotted on the screen.
